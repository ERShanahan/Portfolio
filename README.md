# Ethan Shanahan's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio — a place where you can read my latest work **or challenge me (well, my bot alter ego)** to a game of chess.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a full-stack project built with:
- **React + Vite** for a blazing fast frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek dark mode aesthetics
- **Flask + Stockfish** for a backend chess engine that'll try to outplay you
- **Parallax scroll** for that extra flair

### ♟️ Chess Page
- Live chess board powered by [react-chessboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chessboard)
- Clocks for both sides
- A "Play" button that pits you against **Shanaman**, a clear representation of my **very real** skill in Chess
- Moves are sent to a Python Flask backend that downloads move directly from my Brain
